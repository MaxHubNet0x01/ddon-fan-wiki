          <td>Cutting Wind (Lv. 1)</td>
          <td>Dash forward and then slash; if the enemy is hit, the skill will chain into a second slash.</td>
          <td>Power Increase</td>
          <td>The movement distance is increased and the number of activations rises from one to three, allowing the skill to be used three times in a row without greater stamina consumption. This increases the additional bars from 1 to 3, effectively 4 bars in total.</td>
          <td>Starts with an initial dash; if you collide with an enemy during the dash, you will slash them, if the first slash hits, a second strike will occur, returning through the enemy. If you do not collide with the enemy during the dash, you will make the first slash at the end of the dash, extending the distance. If your hit connects in that way, you will still make the subsequent strike. Strikes can also be directed at different enemies nearby, allowing you to 'aim' at where it goes. (Be careful, the skill does NOT pass through an enemy that is resistant to hitstun or is in the middle of an attack animation. Additionally, additional slashes will not occur if the initial slash is blocked.)</td>

          <td>Power Increase</td>
          <td>Number of strikes increased</td>
          <td>Use your dagger to perform a low-powered uppercut to lift the enemy; whether the enemy is lifted or not, if the uppercut hits, you can follow up with a powder throw which you then ignite to deal fire damage. The powder and ignition part is aimed diagonally upward, so it will miss smaller enemies.</td>

          <td>Back Kick (Lv. 6)</td>
          <td>Leap backward and then kick forward with immunity while resting. If the enemy is hit during the retreat, the skill becomes a counter.</td>
          <td>Power Increase</td>
          <td>Movement changes and number of strikes increased (successful counter results in 3 strikes)</td>
          <td>Dodge takes a step back and then forward with a kick, having invincibility frames during the initial dodge and part of the kick. If an enemy attack passes by you during the backward dodge, the attack will become a counter, a sound will play to indicate a successful counter. The Counter will hit twice with greater damage and more knockback on the second kick. (Fighter players, be careful, this skill has much less invincibility frames due to the faster animation; this is both good and bad. Additionally, the kick does NOT propel you forward like the bars in Hindsight Slash, limiting the range and overall utility of the skill, this applies to both the regular and Counter version.)</td>

          <td>Pulling faster</td>
          <td>Can pull multiple enemies at the same time (maximum of 3)</td>
          <td>Throw your Seeker Grapple/Rope at an enemy in front of you; it will attempt to pull the enemy towards you, leaving them in a down state. This skill is ineffective in most cases as it only works immediately on small enemies. Any enemy with resistance to stun will require you to reach the stun limit before you can pull them towards you. This skill DOES NOT DEAL DAMAGE.</td>

          <td>Falcon Kick (Lv. 13)</td>
          <td>Jump in the air from the ground, latch onto the ground, and dive with a downward kick. If in the air, latch onto the ground and dive with a downward kick. Has a small AoE and hits for Impact Damage.</td>
          <td>Power Increase</td>
          <td>Enemies around are scaled</td>
          <td>This skill has different activation depending on how you use it. If used from the ground, you will jump a great distance into the air before latching onto the ground and diving down. If you use it in the air, it will use your current position to pull you to the ground. The skill itself causes high single-hit impact damage (directly modified by your height from the ground), with a small AoE radius and very high hitstun (enough to knock down most small enemies instantly). Its use against bosses is limited due to the Seeker's playstyle, but it is an excellent skill to cover your lack of dealing with swarms of smaller enemies from the beginning. It is highly recommended to use this in combination with your basic fighting skill to maintain stamina and gain more height for greater damage.</td>

          <td>Jump strength increase</td>
          <td>You can break enemy guard</td>
          <td>This skill behaves differently when used on the ground and in the air. While on the ground, you will make a jump forward, similar to the Hunter's basic jump attack, but instead of pushing yourself backward, you will propel yourself upward onto the enemy you hit. If used in the air, you will perform a stomp move; if it connects, you will push yourself back up. This skill DOES NOT DEAL DAMAGE.</td>

          <td>Cancel your current stance or attack. Useful to avoid enemies during an attack.</td>
          <td>Cooldown time reduced</td>
          <td>Now can be used to cancel stun and repulsion animations after being hit by an enemy. (Use with care when used in swarms)</td>
          <td>Falcon kick height + reset = high jumps.<br>It can also cancel the ‘revive teammate’ animation. Be careful when using it right after being knocked down; you may end up taking more hits when getting back up in front of a crowd.</td>
