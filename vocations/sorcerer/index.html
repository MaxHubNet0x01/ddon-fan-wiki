While it has a very fast casting speed, the spell doesn't come out until the animation plays, leaving you open to interruptions even after the casting part is finished. The damage is actually lower than that of Magic Balls overall, but its area of effect and quick execution time make up for it. Useful when alone, in trouble, or for killing harpies. It has high knockback/hit strength, especially at level 6 and above.</td>

When it reaches level 6, it hits twice, greatly increasing the potential damage and area of effect. This is one of the Wizard's best skills and a spell for dealing damage.

Difficult to use when targeting enemy weak points. It will knock most enemies down if the initial hit hits. It does two additional "burn" attacks on any enemies that are still on fire after the initial hit, but these are much weaker. Season 2.2: -Easy to hit weak points, -Powerful attack approved</td>

          <td>19 seconds</td>
          <td>It has very good vertical range, surpassed only by Frigor and Earthquake. Since all of the damage is focused on just one hit, it is often weaker than other spells for the purpose of dealing damage over a long period of time, simply because of the 9,999 damage cap. However, it is easy to hit most enemies. Weak point with it due to its speed and fast accuracy. The damage is corrected a bit when it reaches level 6, but the other projectiles only deal 30~55% of the original damage, and the long charge time usually doesn't make up for it even if you hit the enemy. Weak point with all three. It has very high blow strength. Season 2.2: - Developed casting time, - Increased attack power for split waves</td>

          <td>19 seconds</td>
          <td>Hits eleven from the ground and eleven downwards. It is not very powerful and has a hard time hitting enemy weak points. As with Crescent Blade, the low number of hits versus the long charge time does not make this a very good spell. The area of effect is slightly larger than Frigor's, but it has a delay before it activates after the spell ends, which can mess with your aim. This is compounded by the time it takes for the gravel to fall and hit again, which can often knock enemies out of the way, preventing the second attack from landing. It has very high blow force and is the Sorc's best stun skill. (In fact, it can hit three times, once while going up, once at maximum height, and once while falling.)</td>

          <td>19 seconds</td>
          <td>While the ability is powerful, I have had moments of failure, from the point in the air they appear to the point where they actually impact the ground. This allows agile enemies to easily avoid this spell if not cast with proper placement/timing. This spell deals damage 2 times per meteor (once by touching the meteor and once by being near the explosion), making the number of possible hits very high. The damage is very high, making this skill extremely powerful if used correctly, especially when an enemy is knocked down. Season 2.2: -Easy to reach weak points</td>

Larger sphere means more range, fewer and fewer hits for all enemies within it. Smaller and stronger scores, up to 13 points. The skill seems most useful if preconditioned and focused on the weak points of defeated bosses, it is also very good for eliminating from safe areas and distant areas full of small enemies.
