      <li>Experience points (XP) are distributed among pawns based on the player's level relative to theirs.</li>
      <li>If the main pawn's level is higher than the player's, they receive slightly reduced XP to prevent them from outpacing the player's progress.</li>
      <li>When the main pawn's level is lower, they gain increased XP to catch up to the player, maintaining balance within the party. This increase can be 10x or more XP than what the player gets.</li>
      <li>For rented pawns, XP gain is proportional to the host player's level, not the renter's, ensuring fairness in progression.</li>
      <li>Level gaps can lead to more significant discrepancies in XP distribution, so keeping pawns close to your level ensures smoother growth for the entire party.</li>

    {% include card-section-list-start.md %}
      <li>Your room, accessible from the Relay Station or via the Within Location tab (Rift Teleport), allows you to customize pawn tactics and grant them special abilities.</li>
      <li>Special abilities include reviving the player or fully restoring the player's health.</li>
      <li>Pawn tactics determine their behavior in battle, such as maintaining distance from enemies, prioritizing specific abilities, or deciding when to heal, buff, or climb foes.</li>

  {% include alert-info.md heading="Important!" content="Special abilities cannot be removed. Your pawn will only use a single skill every x minutes. More skills doesn't mean more casts. So it's better to take one or two skills you think are worth it." %}
