It also hits surprisingly high, easy to damage bosses' weaknesses. When Glyph of Magic is maxed out, it hits much further and harder, also increasing Magic Gauge gains.</td>

Large damage range (bigger than it looks) High damage (without hitting the damage cap) Large casting range (can still be cast at the exact target location even if the mob moves out of range) Priority to hitting the weak spot. The downsides are that you have to stand still and away from enemy attacks while casting AND dealing damage, and that the vortex gets stuck where it's cast.</td>
